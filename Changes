  - Centralize menu icon definition to ensure consistency
  - Add helpers for building state-retaining checkboxes and radio groups

  [UI/UX]
  - Add a loading screen with a ProgressBar widget, and tune size and content
    of init/loading chunks to get to the loading screen quickly, have relatively
    smooth progress throughout, and hide screen flicker from user
  - Define standard layouts that different screens can base themselves on,
    including StandardScreen and its children StandardForm and PrimaryMenu
  - Start defining a full set of main UI screens, including a few early forms
    and several layers of menus with breadcrumbs and inter-level navigation
  - Allow menu screens to declare their own titles and set per-item icons
  - Support translation of titles, breadcrumbs, hints, menu items, buttons, etc.
    and add test translations for main UI screens
  - Allow the UI itself to be tuned by the user via Optional UI Elements screen
    (does not yet save those choices to disk, but _does_ make changes immediately
    visible as soon as the user selects the Save button, persisting through that
    app lifetime)
  - Support large, small, and invisible menu headers, with the small size
    defaulting to autogenerated content, and large defaulting to small
  - Add small logo variants for MainMenu header
  - Load UI preferences defaults from user config during boot
  - Start building an AvailableGames screen that uses data from Lobby client
    (not fully functional yet)
  - Allow launched games to exit either back to shell or to AvailableGames
    screen, depending on how they were launched
  - Make use of game-ui-opts for layout of MainMenu
  - Handle config settings for symbols and vt100-boxes
